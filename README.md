# Project 1 - *Bee Instagram*

**Bee Instagram** is an android app that allows a user to check out popular photos from Instagram. The app utilizes Instagram API to display images and basic image information to the user.

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **scroll through current popular photos** from Instagram
* [X] For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [X] Graphic, Caption, Username
  * [X] Relative timestamp, likes count, user's profile image

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **pull-to-refresh** popular stream to get the latest popular photos
* [X] User can see latest comments for each photo (**bonus** - Show last 2 comments for each photo)
* [X] User can see all the profile images in circles ()
* [X] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading
* [X] Improved the user interface through styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [X] Allow user to view all comments for an image within a separate activity or dialog fragment
* [ ] Allow video posts to be played in full-screen using the VideoView
* [ ] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce boilerplate code.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Use RecyclerView with 2 Customize ViewHolder (depend on item type,recyclerView will change style of item inside) 
* [X] Extend AsyncHttpClient so I can process callback function (Using a part of Observer design pattern)
* [X] Using TabView and ViewPager for loading Image and Video (I found it a crazy thing, I can use Horizontal RecyclerView instead)
* [X] Using Toolbar "scrolling Enter Always animation" (CoordinatorLayout,nestedlayout,appbarlayout with toolbar inside)
* [X] I created a globalVariable Class which can resize the layout for almost device (I depend on the percent of layout height(weight))

## Notes
- It's difficult to use RecyclerView with multiple style and use it inside ScrollView Hierachy :(
- The performance isn't hight because I don't using the HorizontalRecyclerView at the bottom (I used my customized tablayout)
- The design is very bad,I don't know how to arrange layouts together clearly

## Open-source libraries used
